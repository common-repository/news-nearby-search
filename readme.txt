Geotag your posts with Bloom to create a local search and mapping visuals for your readers.

== Description ==

Provides geotagging capabilities for your posts and a local search feature for your readers.  Geotagging is set by your authors, allowing them to define a location discussed in the post.  Bloom places the details of this location into the post's metadata (for search engines to accurately understand) and brings each post together into a search tool where your readers can read content nearby them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I geotag my Posts? =

Create or Edit a Post, then scroll down the page to see the "Article Location"
box.  Search for a location and select an option from the list of results.
Click the Save or Publish button, then your Post will be geotagged with that
location.

= Why do some location searches not give results? =

The only location options shown in the search results will be specific
addresses or intersections.  By default, this plugin does not allow to geotag
articles by neighborhood, city, country or any other imprecise location
description.

= How is the location displayed in a Post? =

The location you select for a Post is not displayed on the front-end of the
webpage. The location is saved as metadata, which means it can be accurately
ready by location-based tools such as search engines, social networks, or
Bloomâ€™s plugins.  Read more at http://www.bloom.li/advocacy/metadata.
